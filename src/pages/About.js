            Nostia was created out of the failure and hardship of planning a group trip in a large group chat, which quickly descended into chaos and a logistical nightmare. Scattered messages, differing plans, and limited scheduling ultimately detracted from the trip, which everyone had been invested into financially and emotionally.

            Nostia takes on the responsibility of organizing, budgeting, and scheduling, to streamline your planning, while ensuring clarity. Our mission is to handle the tedious logistics and details behind an adventure to maximize your adventures financially and emotionally.
